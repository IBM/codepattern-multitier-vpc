# Automate deployment of a multitier web app in a virtual private cloud
In this code pattern we will demonstrate using [IBM Cloud Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started) with Schematics Workspace ([HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)) and Schematics Action ([Red Hat Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible)) to automate infrastucture deployment and configuration for a [multitier](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/three-tier-architecture) architecture that leverages [IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc) for public cloud isolation and separates the web/application and data tiers by deploying VSIs into isolated subnets across different availability zones with network isolation defined using Security Groups and ACLs.  This automated approach leverages [Solution Tutorial - Use Virtual Servers to build highly available and scalable web app](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-highly-available-and-scalable-web-application#use-virtual-servers-to-build-highly-available-and-scalable-web-app).

Infrastructure features used include:

- VPC public cloud isolation.
- Logical network isolation using Security Groups and ACLs.
- Layers on isolated subnets across zones.
- RFC1918 private bring-your-own-IP addresses.
- Global DDOS and Global Load Balancing.
- Bastion and VPN for secure connectivity between on-premise and VPC.
- SysDig and LogDNA for infrastructure and application monitoring. 

Application products used include:

- [LAMP stack](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/lamp-stack-explained) with Linux, MySQL, and PHP.
- [Apache](https://apache.org/) is used as the Web Server.
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com) (popular web, blog and e-commerce platform) demonstrates horizontal scalability across zones.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) (typical open source database) demonstrates multiple database servers and replication strategy across zones.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand:
* How to provision and configure a working VPC environment.
* How to create Terraform scripts and use [Schematics Workspace](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-workspace-setup) to provision infrastructure.
* How to create Ansible playbooks and use [Schematics Action](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-create-playbooks) to configure infrastructure.
  
## Infrastructure Architecture

![infrastructure](doc/source/images/webappvpc-architecture-Infrastructure.svg)

## Infrastructure Flow

1. Users access website from Internet.
2. The website invokes Global LB.
3. Global LB invokes Public ALB.
4. Public ALB balances load to frontend VSIs across zones.
5. Subnets have egress-only access via Public Gateway to Internet.
6. Frontend VSIs invoke backend VSIs.
7. Enterprise users access the VSIs via Floating IP to Bastion Host.
8. Enterprise users/apps can also access the VSIs via VPN connection.

## Application Architecture

![application](doc/source/images/webappvpc-architecture-Application.svg)

## Application Flow

1. Users access website from Internet.
2. The website invokes Global LB.
3. Global LB invokes Public ALB.
4. Public ALB balances load to frontend VSIs across zones.
<!-- 5. Frontend VSIs have NGINX, NGINX Unit, and Wordpress configured to implement the website. -->`
5. Frontend VSIs have Apache and Wordpress configured to implement the website.
6. Frontend VSIs use the source database in the backend VSI.
7. (Future) Frontend VSIs use the replica database in the backend VSI when necessary.
8. (Future) Source and replica Databases are configured for replication across zones.

# Steps

<!--
Use the **Deploy to IBM Cloud** button **OR** create the services and run locally.
-->

<!-- Optionally, add a deploy to ibm cloud button-->

<!--
## Deploy to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/deploy/button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot.git)

1. Press **Deploy to IBM Cloud**, and then click **Deploy**.

2. In Toolchains, click **Delivery Pipeline** to watch while the app is deployed. After it's deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking **View app**.
![toolchain pipeline](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

3. To see the app and services created and configured for this code pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-banking-chatbot` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wbc-` prefix:
    * `wbc-conversation-service`
    * `wbc-discovery-service`
    * `wbc-natural-language-understanding-service`
    * `wbc-tone-analyzer-service`

## Run locally

> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the **Deploy to IBM Cloud** button.

### 1. Clone repo

Clone the `codepattern-multitier-vpc` repo locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/codepattern-multitier-vpc
```

<!--
We’ll be using the file [`data/assistant/workspaces/banking.json`](data/assistant/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder

* Generate an [SSH key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ssh-keys). The SSH key is required to access the provisioned VPC virtual server instances via the bastion host. After you have created your SSH key, make sure to upload this SSH key to your [account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-managing-ssh-keys#managing-ssh-keys-with-ibm-cloud-console) in the VPC region and resource group where you want to deploy this example.

# Sample output

![sample_output](doc/source/images/sample_output.png)
-->

<!--Optionally, include any troubleshooting tips (driver issues, etc)-->

<!--
# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Watson Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used **Deploy to IBM Cloud** the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environment is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Watson Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Watson Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Watson Discovery, check for an old
service thay you might want to delete. Otherwise, use the `.env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID` to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration.
